***in general for all programming lang we use console screen that showing the error what is the error and the location or ehere it lies*** 
***and as example of this we have console in js which have seven fifferent type of errors each one of them creat its own object to let you know discover wher is the error exactly in which line and determin the error by the discription you have.***
