# reading today summery

**this part of reading for the first part of reading from HTML book chapter 6 which is about tables and we can say table represents information in a grid format.Examples of tables include financial reports, TVschedules, and sports results.**

## and the structer of making table as follows

< table > tag
The < table > element is used
to create a table. The contents of the table are written out row by row.
< tr > tag
You indicate the start of each row using the opening < tr > tag. (The tr stands for table row.) It is followed by one or more < td > elements (one for each cell in that row). At the end of the row you use a closing </ tr > tag.
< td >
Each cell of a table is represented using a < td > element. (The td stands for table data.) At the end of each cell you use a closing </ td > tag.
< th > tag
The < th > element is used just like the < td > element but its purpose is to represent the heading for either a column or a row. (The th stands for table heading.) Using < th > elements for headings helps people who use screen readers, improves the ability for search engines to index your pages, and also enables you to control the appearance of tables better when you start to use CSS.
and then the are moving just explaining the most important tags for editing the table and format it .
