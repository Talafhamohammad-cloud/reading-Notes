# dJango forms:

***An HTML Form is a group of one or more fields/widgets on a web page, which can be used to collect information from users for submission to a server. Forms are a flexible mechanism for collecting user input because there are suitable widgets for entering many different types of data, including text boxes, checkboxes, radio buttons, date pickers and so on. Forms are also a relatively secure way of sharing data with the server, as they allow us to send data in POST requests with cross-site request forgery protection.***

## HTML Forms:
The form is defined in HTML as a collection of elements inside <form>...</form> tags, containing at least one input element of type="submit".

The form attributes define the HTTP method used to send the data and the destination of the data on the server (action):
action: The resource/URL where data is to be sent for processing when the form is submitted. If this is not set (or set to an empty string), then the form will be submitted back to the current page URL. method: The HTTP method used to send the data: post or get. The POST method should always be used if the data is going to result in a change to the server's database because this can be made more resistant to cross-site forgery request attacks. The GET method should only be used for forms that don't change user data (e.g. a search form). It is recommended for when you want to be able to bookmark or share the URL. The role of the server is first to render the initial form state â€” either containing blank fields or pre-populated with initial values. After the user presses the submit button, the server will receive the form data with values from the web browser and must validate the information. If the form contains invalid data, the server should display the form again, this time with user-entered data in "valid" fields and messages to describe the problem for the invalid fields. Once the server gets a request with all valid form data, it can perform an appropriate action (e.g. saving the data, returning the result of a search, uploading a file, etc.) and then notify the user.

## The main things that Django's form handling does are:

1- Display the default form the first time it is requested by the user.
    - The form may contain blank fields (e.g. if you're creating a new record), or it may be pre-populated with initial values (e.g. if you are changing a record, or have useful default initial values).
    - The form is referred to as unbound at this point, because it isn't associated with any user-entered data (though it may have initial values).
2- Receive data from a submit request and bind it to the form.
    - Binding data to the form means that the user-entered data and any errors are available when we need to redisplay the form.
3- Clean and validate the data.
    - Cleaning the data performs sanitization of the input (e.g. removing invalid characters that might be used to send malicious content to the server) and converts them into consistent Python types.
    - Validation checks that the values are appropriate for the field (e.g. are in the right date range, aren't too short or too long, etc.)
4- If any data is invalid, re-display the form, this time with any user populated values and error messages for the problem fields.
5- If all data is valid, perform required actions (e.g. save the data, send an email, return the result of a search, upload a file, etc.)
6- Once all actions are complete, redirect the user to another page.

**Django provides a number of tools and approaches to help you with the tasks detailed above. The most fundamental is the Form class, which simplifies both generation of form HTML and data cleaning/validation. In the next section, we describe how forms work using the practical example of a page to allow librarians to renew books.**

***Form The Form class is the heart of Django's form handling system. It specifies the fields in the form, their layout, display widgets, labels, initial values, valid values, and (once validated) the error messages associated with invalid fields. The class also provides methods for rendering itself in templates using predefined formats (tables, lists, etc.) or for getting the value of any element (enabling fine-grained manual rendering).***

### Summary:
Creating and handling forms can be a complicated process! Django makes it much easier by providing programmatic mechanisms to declare, render, and validate forms. Furthermore, Django provides generic form editing views that can do almost all the work to define pages that can create, edit, and delete records associated with a single model instance.
