# Encryption, Decryption & cracking
----------------------------------------------
## Caesar Cipher : 
 it's One of the earliest encryption techniques minvented by Julius Caesar more than two thousand years ago to communicate messages to his allies.

# key aspects of data encryption:
-Encryption: scrambling the data according to a secret key (in this case, the alphabet shift).

-Decryption: recovering the original data from scrambled data by using the secret key.

-Code cracking: uncovering the original data without knowing the secret, by using a variety of clever techniques.


# Three main techniques to crack cipher code :
1- Frequency analysis
Human languages tend to use some letters more than others. For example, "E" is the most popular letter in the English language. We can analyze the frequency of the characters in the message and identify the most likely "E" and narrow down the possible shift amounts based on that.

2-Known plaintext
Another term for the original unencrypted message is plaintext. If the enemy already knew some part of the plaintext, it will be easier for them to crack the rest of the encrypted version.
For example, messages tend to start with similar beginnings. In WWII, encrypted German messages always started with a weather forecast, which ultimately made them easier for British mathematician Alan Turing to crack.

3- Brute force
There are only 25 possible shifts (not 26 — why not?). The enemy could take some time to try out each of them and find one that yielded a sensible message. They wouldn't even need to try the shifts on the entire message, just the first word or two.

# Introduction to Cryptography:
the conclusion of the article :
By developing a greater understanding of the common encryption methods and cryptography algorithms in circulation today, you will be better equipped to protect yourself from potential cyber attacks and breaches in data security.

Although cryptography isn’t perfect, it is necessary to ensure the continued security of your personal information. And with the rapidly evolving landscape of modern data, this topic is more important now than ever before.
