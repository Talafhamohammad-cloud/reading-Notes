The way a company operates and is perceived by both the public and competitors often comes down to the workplace ethics.

Ethical lapses of any kind have the tendency to snowball in a work environment. Once employees see others breaking the rules without repercussions, they may start to think it’s excusable for them to do so as well.

Essentially, a culture where misconduct is tolerated could result in higher turnover, lower productivity, and ultimately, a diminished reputation and profitability.
