# List Comprehensions in Python
It consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause, then zero or more for or if clauses. The expressions can be anything, meaning you can put in all kinds of objects in lists.
The result will be a new list resulting from evaluating the expression in the context of the for and if clauses which follow it.
The list comprehension always returns a result list.
If you used to do it like this:
new_list = []
for i in old_list:
    if filter(i):
        new_list.append(expressions(i))
You can obtain the same thing using list comprehension. Notice the append method has vanished!
new_list = [expression(i) for i in old_list if filter(i)]
Syntax
The list comprehension starts with a ‘[‘ and ‘]’, square brackets, to help you remember that the result is going to be a list.

The basic syntax uses square brackets

[ expression for item in list if conditional ]
This is equivalent to:

for item in list:
    if conditional:
        expression
Let’s break this down and see what it does.
new_list = [expression(i) for i in old_list if filter(i)]
new_list The new list (result).
expression(i) Expression is based on the variable used for each element in the old list.
for i in old_list The word for followed by the variable name to use, followed by the word in the old list.
if filter(i) Apply a filter with an If-statement.
This blog shows an example of how to visually break down the list comprehension:
new_range = [i * i for i in range(5) if i % 2 == 0]
Which corresponds to:
result = [transform iteration filter ]
The * operator is used to repeat. The filter part answers the question if the item should be transformed.
Examples
Now when we know the syntax of list comprehensions, let’s show some examples and how you can use it.
Create a simple list
Let’s start easy by creating a simple list.
x = [i for i in range(10)]
print x
# This will give the output:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
That’s how you can create a simple list.
Create a list using loops and list comprehension
For the next example, assume we want to create a list of squares. Start with an empty list.
# You can either use loops:
squares = []
for x in range(10):
    squares.append(x**2)
print squares
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
# Or you can use list comprehensions to get the same result:
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
print squares
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
Just remember the syntax: [ expression for item in list if conditional ]
Multiplying parts of a list
Multiply every part of a list by three and assign it to a new list.
list1 = [3,4,5]
multiplied = [item*3 for item in list1] 
print multiplied 
[9,12,15]
Note how the item*3 multiplies each piece by 3.
Show the first letter of each word
We will take the first letter of each word and make a list out of it.
listOfWords = ["this","is","a","list","of","words"]
items = [ word[0] for word in listOfWords ]
print items
The output should be: [‘t’, ‘i’, ‘a’, ‘l’, ‘o’, ‘w’]
>>> [x.lower() for x in ["A","B","C"]]
['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> [x.upper() for x in ["a","b","c"]]
['A', 'B', 'C']
Print numbers only from a given string
This example show how to extract all the numbers from a string.
string = "Hello 12345 World"
numbers = [x for x in string if x.isdigit()]
print numbers
>> ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']
Change x.isdigit() to x.isalpha() if you don’t want any numbers.
Parsing a file using list comprehension
In this example, we can see how to get specific lines out from a text file.
Create a text file and put in some text in it.
this is line1 this is line2 this is line3 this is line4 this is line5\
Save the file as test.txt

# Then create the filter by using list comprehension:

fh = open("test.txt", "r")

result = [i for i in fh if "line3" in i]

print result
Output: [‘this is line3‘]

Using list comprehension in functions
Now, let’s see how we can use list comprehension in functions.

# Create a function and name it double:
def double(x):
  return x*2

# If you now just print that function with a value in it, it should look like this:
>>> print double(10)
20
We can easily use list comprehension on that function.

>>> [double(x) for x in range(10)]

print double
[0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]

# You can put in conditions:

>>> [double(x) for x in range(10) if x%2==0]
[0, 4, 8, 12, 16]

# You can add more arguments:

>>> [x+y for x in [10,30,50] for y in [20,40,60]]
[30, 50, 70, 50, 70, 90, 70, 90, 110]
