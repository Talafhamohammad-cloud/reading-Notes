# Dynamic Routes:
import Layout from '../../components/layout'

export default function Post() {
return <Layout>...</Layout>
}

export async function getStaticPaths() {
// Return a list of possible value for id
}

export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
// Fetch necessary data for the blog post using params.id
}

## getStaticPaths:
Create a file called [id].js inside the pages/posts directory.
Also, remove first-post.js inside the pages/posts directory — we’ll no longer use this.
Code
import Layout from '../../components/layout'
export default function Post() {
return <Layout>...</Layout>
}
    export function getAllPostIds() { const fileNames = fs.readdirSync(postsDirectory)
// Returns an array that looks like this:
// [
//   {
//     params: {
//       id: 'ssg-ssr'
//     }
//   },
//   {
//     params: {
//       id: 'pre-rendering'
//     }
//   }
// ]
return fileNames.map(fileName => {
    return {
    params: {
        id: fileName.replace(/\.md$/, '')
    }
    }
})
}
## getStaticProps:
import { getAllPostIds, getPostData } from '../../lib/posts'
export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
const postData = getPostData(params.id)
return {
    props: {
    postData
    }
}
}
## Next.js - Deployment:

### Next.js and Vercel
Vercel is made by the creators of Next.js and has first-class support for Next.js. When you deploy your Next.js app to Vercel, the following happens by default:
Pages that use Static Generation and assets (JS, CSS, images, fonts, etc) will automatically be served from the Vercel Edge Network, which is blazingly fast.
Pages that use Server-Side Rendering and API routes will automatically become isolated Serverless Functions. This allows page rendering and API requests to scale infinitely.

### Vercel has many more features, such as:
Custom Domains: Once deployed on Vercel, you can assign a custom domain to your Next.js app.
Environment Variables: You can also set environment variables on Vercel.
Automatic HTTPS: HTTPS is enabled by default (including custom domains) and doesn't require extra configuration. We auto-renew SSL certificates.

### Develop, Preview, Ship
Develop: We’ve written code in Next.js and used the Next.js development server running to take advantage of its hot reloading feature.
Preview: We’ve pushed changes to a branch on GitHub, and Vercel created a preview deployment that’s available via a URL. We can share this preview URL with others for feedback. In addition to doing code reviews, you can do deployment previews.
Ship: We’ve merged the pull request to main to ship to production.

### Deploy to Vercel
The easiest way to deploy Next.js to production is to use the Vercel platform developed by the creators of Next.js.
    - Create a Vercel Account
    - Import your repository
    - Install Vercel for GitHub. You can give it access to All Repositories.
Once you’ve installed Vercel, import your repo.
You can use default values for the following settings — no need to change anything. Vercel automatically detects that you have a Next.js app and chooses optimal build settings for you.
